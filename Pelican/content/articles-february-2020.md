Summary: Some of the articles I've read in February of 2020. Better late than never.


I've kept up the pace in February, but I can feel that just reading articles is
not going to be enough for me. They are an ok way to pass the time on a train
but don't bring much benefit. For now, I will continue doing this (keeping
a list of articles), but I would like to start reading more books. But that's
going to take some preparation.

[An app can be a home-cooked meal](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/)
and [Shirky: Situated
Software](https://web.archive.org/web/20040411202042/http://www.shirky.com/writings/situated_software.html)
are related to the theme of sustainable software. I'm not planning on writing
any applications yet. Thought I started about something else - ditching Facebook
for keeping in contact with my group of close friends in favor of something
smaller, private. And possibly self-hosted.


[Why SQLite succeeded as a database with Richard Hipp, creator of SQLite (The Changelog #201) |> News and podcasts for developers |> Changelog](https://changelog.com/podcast/201)
is a podcast, althought there is a transcript. I always knew SQLite existed but this
interview got me interested. I am now looking for ways to use it in some
project.


[Old CSS, new CSS / fuzzy
notepad](https://eev.ee/blog/2020/02/01/old-css-new-css/?fbclid=IwAR1oxGs11ixev9c6qaK1yy8oiZvc4lB7dyxebGpcrec6bFxM0qzJqz03WqM)
sent shivers down my spine. How could the web ever get to where it is
today?


[Why Discord is switching from Go to Rust - Discord Blog](https://blog.discordapp.com/why-discord-is-switching-from-go-to-rust-a190bbca2b1f)

I've wanted to get into more programming languages for a long time. Go seemed
like something I would enjoy, but lately, Rust seems more and more appealing.
We now have some code done in Rust, and I'm tempted to give it a go.


And now we even have some coding done in Rust at work, I'm tempted to get into
it even more. Now just to find some spare time.


[Why procrastination is about managing emotions, not time - BBC Worklife](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200121-why-procrastination-is-about-managing-emotions-not-time)
and [Acceptance and commitment therapy - Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_and_commitment_therapy)
got my attention because I'd never thought about procrastination like that. In
all the years of trying to battle procrastionation. I always treated like a time
management problem (like most people).


[The Silicon Valley Economy Is Here. And It’s a Nightmare. | The New
Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/156202/silicon-valley-economy-here-its-nightmare?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=audm)
and [End the GOP | The New
Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/156411/end-gop) are only the only two
articles from The New Republic that I found reading this month. I'm honestly
disappointed with TNR's mailing list. It's mostly paid political campaign
advertising and podcast promotion (I don't listen to podcasts). I'm going to
un-subscribe.


[Jeffrey Paul: Discord Is Not An Acceptable Choice For Free Software Projects](https://sneak.berlin/20200220/discord-is-not-an-acceptable-choice-for-free-software-projects/)
I've never used Discord, and I don't plan to. Now I also have a reason why.

[Latacora - Stop Using Encrypted
Email](https://latacora.micro.blog/2020/02/19/stop-using-encrypted.html) - I
wasn't and I won't now.


February was the month that Avast got a lot of flak for selling users data
through Jumpshot. There was a lot of mostly bad and some ok press. [Avast's
Shutdown of Jumpshot Will Harm the Web and the World |
SparkToro](https://sparktoro.com/blog/avasts-shutdown-of-jumpshot-will-harm-the-web-and-the-world/)
and [Zlý Avast a velká lekce pokrytectví - Euro.cz](https://www.euro.cz/blogy/zly-avast-a-velka-lekce-pokrytectvi)


This sounds too good to be true: [Radical hydrogen-boron reactor leapfrogs
current nuclear fusion tech](https://newatlas.com/energy/hb11-hydrogen-boron-fusion-clean-energy/).


[Thread by @gravislizard: "almost everything on computers is perceptually slower than it was in 1983 amber-screen library computer in 1998: type in two words and hit F […]"](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/927593460642615296.html)
is just a rant about crappy software that seems to surround us. I can agree with
that. What I did not enjoy is the format - using long Twitter threads is just
lazy. Then again, maybe it's the best format for angry rants.
