Summary: A list of articles I've read in January of 2020 with commentary.


Last months' list is much longer than the one before that - 38 articles opposed
to 13 in December of last year (though I did a lot of filtering then).

A lot of articles fall into "not that interesting" category. I tend to just
bookmark everything I see and often the articles are not that great. I read them
anyway because I'm bored on my way to/from work. The truth is, reading articles
is just another way to kill time. But this is arguably better than scrolling
through Twitter or Facebook.

This time I will break the list down into categories.


### Sustainability
LOW-TECH MAGAZINE is pretty interesting and I've subscribed to them.
While everyone talks vaguely about technology solving climate change,
authors of this magazine are skeptical about high-tech solutions and are looking
for low-tech ones.

Articles linked below are interesting because they are hosted on a
static, solar-powered website that goes down if there is not enough power.

[How to Make Wind Power Sustainable Again - LOW←TECH MAGAZINE](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2019/06/wooden-wind-turbines.html)

This article is about the unsustainability of modern wind turbines. Turbines are
made of carbon-fiber and other materials that can't be recycled and are
difficult to get rid of. Authors explore ways to make wind power more
sustainable.

[Mist Showers: Sustainable Decadence? - LOW←TECH MAGAZINE](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2019/10/mist-showers-sustainable-decadence.html)

As someone who likes to take looong hot sowers, I found this article a bit
disconcerting. But in the end, I got curious if there is a way to save a bunch of
water and energy while keeping some level of comfort with mist showers. This
article claims there is.

[This Page is Designed to Last: A Manifesto for Preserving Content on the Web](https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/)

This article is not really about the environment but the sustainability of
content on the Internet. I'm thinking about this topic more and more lately.
Wouldn't it be great if the Internet was more like a library than television?


### Software development
[Get your work recognized: write a brag document - Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/)

I'm coming back to this blog once in a while and always find something
interesting. I enjoy Julia's posts a lot. The idea of a "brag document" is
brilliant and I'm going to put one together soon. If only just for myself.


[Goodbye, Clean Code — Overreacted](https://overreacted.io/goodbye-clean-code/)
and [The Wrong Abstraction — Sandi Metz](https://www.sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction)

Sometimes clean code™ is not the same as the best code. The author shows an
example where code duplication is better than an unnecessary abstraction
(that does more harm than good in the long run).

This is something we are starting to deal at work right now - modules in one
of our back-end applications are very similar (but not identical)
and we can't agree whether abstraction will help us or not.

New-comers argue that we should abstract, "old" guys say they have been down
this road before and it was not good (we are talking senior engineers on
both sides here).


[Evidence Based Scheduling – Joel on Software](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2007/10/26/evidence-based-scheduling/)

Joel claims to have found a successful, scientific method for scheduling of
software projects. I would love to try this method out in our team sometimes.
One thing I find difficult is tracking time spent on different tasks in a way
that would support this method and not be a nuisance.


[Stop Using Markdown For Documentation · Mister Gold](https://mister-gold.pro/posts/en/asciidoc-vs-markdown/)

I'm using Markdown for everything, including documentation (usually in
the form of READMEs) but even before finishing this article I've realized how
bad it is for this purpose. I will try `asciidoc` sometime in the
future when I need to write some serious documentation.


[Gregory Szorc's Digital Home | Mercurial's Journey to and Reflections on Python 3](https://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2020/01/13/mercurial%27s-journey-to-and-reflections-on-python-3/)

I'm a huge Python fan but I will be first to agree that it has some major flaws,
especially when it comes Python 2/3 migration. It was interesting to read about
painful transition in a really big project.



[How This Blog Was Made |
Teetotality](https://teetotality.blog/posts/how-this-blog-was-made/), [Why build
this blog - or anything - on IPFS? |
Teetotality](http://teetotality.blog/posts/why-ipfs/) and [A Beginner’s Guide to IPFS - By](https://hackernoon.com/a-beginners-guide-to-ipfs-20673fedd3f)

I got curious about IPFS (Interplanetary File System) after reading the first
article. I'm not sure it is useful to me now but it is something I'm going to
watch closely (this is related to the sustainable Internet). It also reminded me
about an experimental build and dependency management tool for Scala called
[Fury](https://fury.build/) which uses IPFS to distribute packages.


[Performance first @ tonsky.me](https://tonsky.me/blog/performance-first/)

The author disagrees with the quote

> Premature optimization is the root of all evil

and I'm wondering if he is right. Maybe if making software wasn't so cheap
there would be more good software.


[Docker is the dangerous gamble which we will regret | Smash Company](https://archive.is/zkmaE)

I'm using Docker a lot at work but this article made me realize I know nothing
about it.


[How I deploy — Honza Javorek](https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/how-i-deploy?fbclid=IwAR3QI-qGGHu6VPcJwLhWUhwAh-9CsJ9OnwdJeqxjaEAKufMfjEqRLa5PD0U)

Honza talks about different ways he tries to make his life easier when creating
websites (blogs, documentation, web apps) like static site generators, free CI
and FaaS platforms and more.

He is a big fan of [Zeit.co](https://zeit.co/home) and made me want to try it
out again.


[Devil's Dictionary of Programming — programming is terrible](https://programmingisterrible.com/post/65781074112/devils-dictionary-of-programming)

A funny joke.


### Political
[Treat Yourself | The Point Magazine](https://thepointmag.com/examined-life/treat-yourself/)

I don't remember where I got this one but my first thought after looking at the
title was "let's see what kind of self-help nonsense they will try to sell me
this time". Only after getting a couple of pages into this essay did I realize
it is a critique of self-care as well as of constant feeling of being oppressed
by capitalism that is common among Millenials (whoever they might be). I'm still
unpacking this one and will probably read it for the third and maybe even fourth
time. There is just something in there I can't put my finger on.

I came across [The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/) and read a couple of
articles in one sitting. I'm not sure what to think about the magazine. I've
subscribed to their newsletter but it's mostly paid promotions and offers of
$4000 all-inclusive trips to Cuba (to meet with local intellectuals and to
support the revolution, I guess?).

I think I'm reading too much about politics in the USA and need to focus on
Europe more. Which I will do in the future.

Here are the articles from TNR:

* [The Loneliness of the Resistance Protester | The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/155999/loneliness-resistance-protester?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=audm)
* [State Under Siege | The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/155273/state-siege?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=audm)
* [High Crimes | The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/155643/trump-articles-of-impeachment-high-crimes?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=audm)

[Piráti jako děti? Ok, boomers. Klišé nám jejich politiku ale nevysvětlí – A2larm](https://a2larm.cz/2020/01/pirati-jako-deti-ok-boomers-klise-nam-jejich-politiku-ale-nevysvetli/)

I keep getting promoted posts from A2larm on Facebook. The articles are hit and
miss. This one is about the Czech Pirate Party and how everyone treats them as
if they are children and new to politics when in fact they've been here for more
than 10 years and did a lot of work on different levels of government.

## Notes and takeaways

This list is generated automatically from bookmarks in my browser. The text is
written manually. I've used [Grammarly](grammarly.com) for the first time and
I'm glad it didn't find too many errors. If only there was a way to integrate it
into Vim...

I like looking back at the articles I've read and re-reading some of them. There
is always something I would like to come back to but I rarely do. Here are
takeaways from this month (maybe this will help me to remember to look at them
later):

* Create a brag document
* Look more into sustainable Internet
* Read more about European politics
* Check out [Zeit.co](https://zeit.co/home) again

I will continue to log articles I read but maybe with more focus on quality over
quantity.
