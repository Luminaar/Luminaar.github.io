                <p>Last months&#8217; list is much longer than the one before that - 38 articles opposed
to 13 in December of last year (though I did a lot of filtering&nbsp;then).</p>
<p>A lot of articles fall into &#8220;not that interesting&#8221; category. I tend to just
bookmark everything I see an often the articles are not that great. I read them
anyway because I&#8217;m bored on my way to/from work. The truth is, reading articles
is just another way to kill time. But this is arguably better than scrolling
through Twitter or&nbsp;Facebook.</p>
<p>This time I will break the list down into&nbsp;categories.</p>
<h3>Sustainability</h3>
<p><span class="caps">LOW</span>-<span class="caps">TECH</span> <span class="caps">MAGAZINE</span> is pretty interesting and I&#8217;ve subscribed to them.
While everyone talks vaguely about technology solving global warming,
authors of this magazine are skeptical about high-tech solutions and are looking
for low-tech&nbsp;ones.</p>
<p>Articles linked below are interesting because they are hosted on a
static, solar-powered website that goes down if there is not enough&nbsp;power.</p>
<p><a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2019/06/wooden-wind-turbines.html">How to Make Wind Power Sustainable Again - <span class="caps">LOW</span>←<span class="caps">TECH</span> <span class="caps">MAGAZINE</span></a></p>
<p>This article is about the unsustainability of modern wind turbines. Turbines are
made of carbon-fiber and other materials can not be recycled and are
difficult to get rid of. Authors explore ways to make wind power more&nbsp;sustainable.</p>
<p><a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2019/10/mist-showers-sustainable-decadence.html">Mist Showers: Sustainable Decadence? - <span class="caps">LOW</span>←<span class="caps">TECH</span> <span class="caps">MAGAZINE</span></a></p>
<p>As someone who likes to take looong hot sowers, I found this article a bit
disconcerting. But in the end, I got curious if there is a way to save a bunch of
water and energy while keeping some level of comfort with mist showers. This
article claims there&nbsp;is.</p>
<p><a href="https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/">This Page is Designed to Last: A Manifesto for Preserving Content on the&nbsp;Web</a></p>
<p>This article is not really about the environment but the sustainability of
content on the Internet. I&#8217;m thinking about this topic more and more lately.
Wouldn&#8217;t it be great if the Internet was more like a library than a <span class="caps">TV</span>?</p>
<h3>Software&nbsp;development</h3>
<p><a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/">Get your work recognized: write a brag document - Julia&nbsp;Evans</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m coming back to this blog once in a while and always find something
interesting. I enjoy Julia&#8217;s posts a lot. The idea of a &#8220;brag document&#8221; is
brilliant and I&#8217;m going to put one together for myself soon. If only just for&nbsp;myself.</p>
<p><a href="https://overreacted.io/goodbye-clean-code/">Goodbye, Clean Code — Overreacted</a>
and <a href="https://www.sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction">The Wrong Abstraction — Sandi&nbsp;Metz</a></p>
<p>Sometimes clean code™ is not the same as the best code. The author shows an
example where code duplication is better than an unnecessary abstraction
(that does more harm than good in the long&nbsp;run).</p>
<p>This is something we are starting to deal at work right now - modules in one
of our back-end applications are very similar (but not identical)
and we can&#8217;t agree whether abstraction will help us or&nbsp;not.</p>
<p>New-comers argue that we should abstract, &#8220;old&#8221; guys say they have been down
this road before and it was not good (we are talking senior engineers on
both sides&nbsp;here).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2007/10/26/evidence-based-scheduling/">Evidence Based Scheduling – Joel on&nbsp;Software</a></p>
<p>Joel claims to have found a successful, scientific method for scheduling of
software projects. I would love to try this method out in our team sometimes.
One thing I find difficult is tracking time spent on different tasks in a way
that would support this method and not be a&nbsp;nuisance.</p>
<p><a href="https://mister-gold.pro/posts/en/asciidoc-vs-markdown/">Stop Using Markdown For Documentation · Mister&nbsp;Gold</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m using Markdown for everything, including documentation (usually in
the form of READMEs) but even before finishing this article I&#8217;ve realized how
bad it is for this purpose. I will try <code>asciidoc</code> sometime in the
future when I need to write some serious&nbsp;documentation.</p>
<p><a href="https://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2020/01/13/mercurial%27s-journey-to-and-reflections-on-python-3/">Gregory Szorc&#8217;s Digital Home | Mercurial&#8217;s Journey to and Reflections on Python&nbsp;3</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m a huge Python fan but I will be first to agree that it has some major flaws,
especially when it comes Python 2/3 migration. It was interesting to read about
painful transition in a really big&nbsp;project.</p>
<p><a href="https://teetotality.blog/posts/how-this-blog-was-made/">How This Blog Was Made |
Teetotality</a>, <a href="http://teetotality.blog/posts/why-ipfs/">Why build
this blog - or anything - on <span class="caps">IPFS</span>? |
Teetotality</a> and <a href="https://hackernoon.com/a-beginners-guide-to-ipfs-20673fedd3f">A Beginner’s Guide to <span class="caps">IPFS</span> -&nbsp;By</a></p>
<p>I got curious about <span class="caps">IPFS</span> after reading the first article. I&#8217;m not sure it is
useful to me now but it is certainly something I would like to keep an eye out
for (related to the sustainable Internet). It also reminded me about
an experimental build tool and dependency management for Scala called
<a href="https://fury.build/">Fury</a> which uses <span class="caps">IPFS</span> to distribute&nbsp;packages.</p>
<p><a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/performance-first/">Performance first @&nbsp;tonsky.me</a></p>
<p>The author disagrees with the&nbsp;quote</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Premature optimization is the root of all&nbsp;evil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and I&#8217;m wondering if he is right. Maybe if making software wasn&#8217;t so cheap,
there would be more good&nbsp;software.</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.is/zkmaE">Docker is the dangerous gamble which we will regret | Smash&nbsp;Company</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m using Docker a lot at work but this article made me realize I know nothing
about&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><a href="https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/how-i-deploy?fbclid=IwAR3QI-qGGHu6VPcJwLhWUhwAh-9CsJ9OnwdJeqxjaEAKufMfjEqRLa5PD0U">How I deploy — Honza&nbsp;Javorek</a></p>
<p>Honza talks about different ways he tries to make his life easier when creating
websites (blogs, documentation, web apps) like static site generators, free <span class="caps">CI</span>
and FaaS platforms and&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>He is a big fan of <a href="https://zeit.co/home">Zeit.co</a> and made me want to try it
out&nbsp;again.</p>
<p><a href="https://programmingisterrible.com/post/65781074112/devils-dictionary-of-programming">Devil&#8217;s Dictionary of Programming — programming is&nbsp;terrible</a></p>
<p>A funny&nbsp;joke.</p>
<h3>Political</h3>
<p><a href="https://thepointmag.com/examined-life/treat-yourself/">Treat Yourself | The Point&nbsp;Magazine</a></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t remember where I got this one but my first thought after looking at the
title was &#8220;let&#8217;s see what kind of self-help nonsense they will try to sell me
this time&#8221;. Only after getting a couple of pages into this essay did I realize
it is a critique of self-care as well as of constant &#8220;struggle&#8221; and
&#8220;resistance&#8221; against capitalism that is common among Millenials (whatever
that means). I&#8217;m still unpacking this one and will probably read it for the
third and maybe even fourth time. There is just something in there I can&#8217;t put
my finger&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>I came across <a href="https://newrepublic.com/">The New Republic</a> and read a couple of
articles in one sitting. I not sure how what to think about the magazine. I&#8217;ve
subscribed to their newsletter but it&#8217;s mostly paid promotions and offers of
$4000 all-inclusive trips to Cuba (to meet with local intellectuals and to
support the revolution, I&nbsp;guess?).</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;m reading too much about politics in the <span class="caps">USA</span> and need to focus on
Europe more. Which I will do in the&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>Here are the articles from <span class="caps">TNR</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/155999/loneliness-resistance-protester?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=audm">The Loneliness of the Resistance Protester | The New&nbsp;Republic</a></li>

<li><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/155643/trump-articles-of-impeachment-high-crimes?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=audm">High Crimes | The New&nbsp;Republic</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://a2larm.cz/2020/01/pirati-jako-deti-ok-boomers-klise-nam-jejich-politiku-ale-nevysvetli/">Piráti jako děti? Ok, boomers. Klišé nám jejich politiku ale nevysvětlí –&nbsp;A2larm</a></p>
<p>I keep getting promoted posts from A2larm on Facebook. The articles are hit and
miss. This one is about the Czech Pirate Party and how everyone treats them as
if they are children and are new to politics when in fact they&#8217;ve been here for more
than 10 years and did a lot of work on different levels of&nbsp;government.</p>

<h2>Notes and&nbsp;takeaways</h2>
<p>This list is generated automatically from bookmarks in my browser. The text is
written manually. I&#8217;ve used <a href="grammarly.com">Grammarly</a> for the first time and
I&#8217;m glad it didn&#8217;t find too many errors. If only there was a way to integrate it
into&nbsp;Vim&#8230;</p>
<p>I like looking back at the articles I&#8217;ve read and re-reading some of them. There
is always something I would like to come back to but I rarely do. Here are
takeaways from this month (maybe this will help me to remember to look at them&nbsp;later):</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a brag&nbsp;document</li>
<li>Look more into sustainable&nbsp;Internet</li>
<li>Read more about European&nbsp;politics</li>
<li>Check out <a href="https://zeit.co/home">Zeit.co</a>&nbsp;again</li>
</ul>
<p>I will continue to log articles I read but maybe with more focus on quality over&nbsp;quantity.</p>
