= Classify files submitted by our users

== Why do it?
We are receiving files with some information - sha256, file path, prevalence
(added by our internal system), file size and file type.

We would like to rank those file (RARE, COMMON, ...). This rank will be used in
further analysis.

We need to have a file name (last part of the file path). This is used by other
services.

== Definition of done
There is an application that classifies files received from our users. The
classifications are made available for further use.

== Implementation details
Files received from users are available from RabbitMQ exchange
"UserSubmittedFiles".

Add a classification for each file and send it to exchange "RankedFiles"
