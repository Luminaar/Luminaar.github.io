== Introduction

- How to use Pytest - where to put tests, how to structure them, how to run
them, how to understand the output

- How to write tests together with code, not after you've finished it

- The most useful features (parametrization, fixtures)

NOTE: Recording  of this meeting will be available after and I will create some kind
of a transcript.

== Motivation

Common knowledge: that you _should_, no -- *must* -- write tests.

But for most people writing tests is a chore:

> I've finished the task, I just need to add tests.

Tests are skipped during code review.

Tests are an afterthought.


=== How test can improve your life

That even if you don't write tests, you still test your code -- Pytest will make
it much easier

What to test -- you are not going to have 100% test coverage. Which parts to
choose then?

Design better programs by writing tests -- more testable, readable,
refactorable, maintainable
